# Problem: Reverse the List and Print the Result

## **Explanation** ğŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to reverse the list `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and print the result. To solve this:

1. **Reversing the list**: In Python, the `reverse()` method is used to reverse the elements of the list in place.
2. **Printing the result**: After reversing the list, we can print the result to confirm that the elements are in reversed order.

### **Code Example** ğŸ“œ

```python
# List of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Reversing the list
numbers.reverse()

# Printing the reversed list
print("Reversed list:", numbers)
