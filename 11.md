# Problem: Create a List Comprehension to Generate the Squares of Numbers from 1 to 10

## **Explanation** ðŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to create a list comprehension that generates a list of the squares of numbers from 1 to 10. To solve this:

1. **List comprehension**: List comprehension is a concise way to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable.
2. **Squaring the numbers**: We will square each number from 1 to 10 using the expression `x**2`, where `x` represents each number in the range.

### **Code Example** ðŸ“œ

```python
# List comprehension to generate squares of numbers from 1 to 10
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)]

# Printing the result
print("Squares of numbers from 1 to 10:", squares)
