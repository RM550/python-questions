# Problem: Append the Number 60 to the List and Print the Updated List

## **Explanation** ðŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to append the number `60` to an existing list `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and then print the updated list. To solve this:

1. **Appending an element**: In Python, the `append()` method is used to add an element to the end of a list.
2. **Printing the updated list**: After appending the number `60`, we can print the updated list to confirm that the element has been added.

### **Code Example** ðŸ“œ

```python
# Original list
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Appending 60 to the list
numbers.append(60)

# Printing the updated list
print("Updated list:", numbers)
