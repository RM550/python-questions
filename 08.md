# Problem: Find the Index of the Number 40 in the List

## **Explanation** ðŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to find the index of the number `40` in the list `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`. To solve this:

1. **Finding the index**: In Python, the `index()` method is used to find the index of a specific element in the list. The index of the first occurrence of the element is returned.
2. **Printing the result**: After finding the index of the number `40`, we can print it.

### **Code Example** ðŸ“œ

```python
# List of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Finding the index of number 40
index_of_40 = numbers.index(40)

# Printing the result
print("The index of 40 in the list is:", index_of_40)
