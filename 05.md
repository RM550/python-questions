# Problem: Remove the Number 30 from the List and Print the Updated List

## **Explanation** ðŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to remove the number `30` from the list `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and print the updated list. To solve this:

1. **Removing an element**: In Python, the `remove()` method is used to remove a specific element from the list.
2. **Printing the updated list**: After removing the number `30`, we can print the updated list to confirm that the element has been removed.

### **Code Example** ðŸ“œ

```python
# Original list
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Removing 30 from the list
numbers.remove(30)

# Printing the updated list
print("Updated list:", numbers)
