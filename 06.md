# Problem: Pop the Last Element from the List and Print the Updated List

## **Explanation** ðŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to pop the last element from the list `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and print the updated list. To solve this:

1. **Popping an element**: In Python, the `pop()` method is used to remove an element from the list. By default, if no index is provided, it removes the last element.
2. **Printing the updated list**: After popping the last element, we can print the updated list to confirm that the element has been removed.

### **Code Example** ðŸ“œ

```python
# Original list
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Popping the last element
numbers.pop()

# Printing the updated list
print("Updated list:", numbers)
