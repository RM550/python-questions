# Problem: Sort the List in Ascending Order and Print the Result

## **Explanation** ðŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to sort the list `[5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]` in ascending order and print the result. To solve this:

1. **Sorting the list**: In Python, the `sort()` method is used to sort a list in ascending order by default.
2. **Printing the result**: After sorting the list, we can print the result to confirm that the elements are in ascending order.

### **Code Example** ðŸ“œ

```python
# List of numbers
numbers = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]

# Sorting the list in ascending order
numbers.sort()

# Printing the sorted list
print("Sorted list in ascending order:", numbers)
