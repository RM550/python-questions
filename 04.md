# Problem: Insert the Number 25 at the 3rd Position and Print the Updated List

## **Explanation** ðŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to insert the number `25` at the 3rd position in the list `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and then print the updated list. To solve this:

1. **Inserting an element**: In Python, the `insert()` method is used to add an element at a specific position in a list. The index of the position starts from `0`, so the 3rd position would be index `2`.
2. **Printing the updated list**: After inserting the number `25` at the specified position, we can print the updated list to confirm that the element has been added correctly.

### **Code Example** ðŸ“œ

```python
# Original list
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Inserting 25 at the 3rd position (index 2)
numbers.insert(2, 25)

# Printing the updated list
print("Updated list:", numbers)
