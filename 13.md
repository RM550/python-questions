# Problem: Create a List Comprehension that Generates a List of Tuples with Numbers and Their Squares

## **Explanation** ğŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to create a list comprehension that generates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a number and its square (e.g., `[(1, 1), (2, 4), ...]`). To solve this:

1. **List comprehension**: We can use list comprehension to iterate through a range of numbers and create tuples of the form `(x, x**2)`, where `x` is the number and `x**2` is its square.
2. **Generating the list of tuples**: For each number in the range, we create a tuple that consists of the number and its square.

### **Code Example** ğŸ“œ

```python
# Creating a list comprehension that generates tuples of numbers and their squares
number_square_tuples = [(x, x**2) for x in range(1, 11)]

# Printing the result
print("List of tuples with numbers and their squares:", number_square_tuples)
