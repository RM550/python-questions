# Problem: Remove All Occurrences of the Value 3 from the List

## **Explanation** ðŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to remove all occurrences of the value `3` from the list `[1, 3, 5, 3, 7, 3, 9]`. To solve this:

1. **List comprehension**: We can use list comprehension to filter out the value `3` from the list.
2. **Condition check**: We will check if each element is not equal to `3` and include it in the new list if the condition is satisfied.

### **Code Example** ðŸ“œ

```python
# Original list
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 3, 7, 3, 9]

# Removing all occurrences of 3 using list comprehension
numbers_without_3 = [num for num in numbers if num != 3]

# Printing the result
print("List after removing all occurrences of 3:", numbers_without_3)
