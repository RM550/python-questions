# Problem: Count the Occurrences of the Number 2 in the List

## **Explanation** ðŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to count how many times the number `2` appears in the list `[2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 8]`. To solve this:

1. **Counting occurrences**: In Python, the `count()` method is used to count the occurrences of a specific element in a list.
2. **Printing the result**: After counting the number of times `2` appears, we can print the result.

### **Code Example** ðŸ“œ

```python
# List of numbers
numbers = [2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 8]

# Counting the occurrences of number 2
count_of_2 = numbers.count(2)

# Printing the result
print("The number 2 occurs", count_of_2, "times in the list.")
