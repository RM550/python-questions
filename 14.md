# Problem: Flatten a List of Lists Using List Comprehension

## **Explanation** ðŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to flatten a list of lists `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]` into a single list. To solve this using list comprehension:

1. **List comprehension**: We will use list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and each element inside those sublists, creating a new, flat list with all the elements.
2. **Flattening the list**: For each sublist, we will extract its elements and add them to a new list.

### **Code Example** ðŸ“œ

```python
# List of lists
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

# Flattening the list using list comprehension
flattened_list = [item for sublist in list_of_lists for item in sublist]

# Printing the result
print("Flattened list:", flattened_list)
