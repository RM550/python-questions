# Problem: Create a List of the First 10 Natural Numbers and Print It

## **Explanation** ğŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to create a list of the first 10 natural numbers (from 1 to 10) and print it. To solve this:

1. **Creating the list**: We can use the `range()` function to generate numbers from 1 to 10 and convert it into a list.
2. **Printing the list**: After creating the list, we can print it to display the first 10 natural numbers.

### **Code Example** ğŸ“œ

```python
# Creating a list of the first 10 natural numbers
natural_numbers = list(range(1, 11))

# Printing the list
print("The first 10 natural numbers are:", natural_numbers)
