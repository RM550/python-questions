# Problem: Filter Even Numbers from a List Using List Comprehension

## **Explanation** ðŸ§ 

In this problem, we need to filter the even numbers from the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` using list comprehension. To solve this:

1. **List comprehension**: List comprehension allows us to create a new list by applying a condition to filter out specific elements from the original list.
2. **Condition for even numbers**: An even number is any number that is divisible by 2, which can be checked using the condition `x % 2 == 0`.

### **Code Example** ðŸ“œ

```python
# Original list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Filtering even numbers using list comprehension
even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]

# Printing the result
print("Even numbers from the list:", even_numbers)
